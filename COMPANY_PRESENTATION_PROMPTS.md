```
**Output**: Beautiful, functional charts
**Manual Effort**: 15% (styling refinements)

### 8. **Performance Optimization** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```
"Optimize for production: code splitting, React.memo for expensive components, bundle size <500KB, initial load <3s, prevent memory leaks, efficient image loading with placeholders."
```
**Output**: Performance-optimized application
**Manual Effort**: 30% (fine-tuning metrics)

### 9. **Error Handling & UX** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```
"Implement comprehensive error handling: API failures with user-friendly messages, network issues, graceful degradation, loading states, accessibility improvements, mobile touch optimization."
```
**Output**: Robust error management system
**Manual Effort**: 10% (edge case testing)

### 10. **Professional Documentation** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```
"Generate interview-ready documentation including technical specs, API guide, deployment instructions, testing procedures, and troubleshooting. Include code examples and performance metrics."
```
**Output**: Comprehensive project documentation
**Manual Effort**: 5% (formatting and organization)
