3. **Memory Leaks in Intervals**: Debugged useEffect cleanup, manually added proper interval clearing logic
4. **Currency Conversion Failures**: Investigated CoinGecko rate limits, manually implemented retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
5. **Mobile Performance Issues**: Profiled component re-renders, manually optimized with React.memo and useCallback

**My Investigation Approach:**
- Used browser DevTools for performance profiling and network analysis
- Added extensive console logging for data source tracking
- Implemented step-by-step debugging for complex state management
- Created isolated test cases for API edge cases
- Manually tested error scenarios (network failures, API limits)

**Key Insight**: AI provided the foundation, but human debugging skills were essential for production-ready reliability.
